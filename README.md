the data base can be simply

TABLE PAGES {
    KEY = Id of the instance
    TEXT = the text of the page
    BUTTONS_TEXT = Text of the button (list)
    BUTTON_PATH = Matching to BUTTONS for the KEY of the page they send you to
    ACTION = Actions from the pages (ex: gain +1 strength, loose hp, gain reputation etc)
}

TABLE CHARACTER{
    KEY = id
    NAME = 
    
}
